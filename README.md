# Data Mining Project

## Overview
This repository contains a data mining software developed from scratch for a university project. The software is designed to mine datasets using various data mining methods. It provides a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) that enables users to perform data mining tasks efficiently.
It is divided into two parts: data analysis, preprocessing, and visualization; and supervised and unsupervised learning.

## Part 1: Data Analysis, Preprocessing, and Visualization
In this part, we analyze, preprocess, and visualize two datasets ([Dataset 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zcNeHEEoi9XmpPYcUKTqRB_VngeQGZEK/view) and Dataset 2). We also extract frequent patterns and association rules from a third dataset (Dataset 3).

### Dataset 1 and 2: Analysis, Preprocessing, and Visualization
In this part, we process two types of data: static and time series.

### Dataset 3: Frequent Pattern and Association Rule Extraction
Wr desctized the some column of the Dataset 3, then extracted the frequent patterns and association rules.

## Part 2: Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
In this part, we apply classification and prediction techniques to Dataset 1. We also perform clustering on Dataset 1.

### Dataset 1: Classification and Prediction
We use the following supervised learning models:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

### Dataset 1: Clustering
We use the following unsupervised learning models:
- K-Means Clustering
- DBSCAN

## Features
The data mining software offers the following features:

1. Data Preprocessing: The software provides preprocessing functionalities to clean and transform the data before mining. This includes handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature scaling.

2. Data Exploration: Users can explore the dataset visually through interactive charts and statistical summaries.

3. Data Mining Methods: The software implements a range of data mining methods, including but not limited to:
    - Classification: Build classification models using algorithms like decision trees, random forests, and knn.
    - Clustering: Perform clustering analysis using algorithms like k-means and DBSCAN.
    - Association Rule Mining: Discover frequent itemsets and association rules using algorithms like Apriori and FP-Growth.
    - Anomaly Detection: Identify anomalies or outliers in the dataset.

4. Model Evaluation: The software provides evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the data mining models, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, Silouette score and ARI

6. Model Visualization: Users can visualize the trained models, decision boundaries, and cluster assignments.
